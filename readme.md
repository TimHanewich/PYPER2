## Design Notes
- Specs of original drive shaft gear: https://i.imgur.com/a3ub9se.png
- Specs of original motor gear (attached to TT motor): https://i.imgur.com/Kuyyccg.png

## Gear meshing
- V1 (`aa49e953b27462eb5363fe68f89ab68bb7c1dbf4`) = baseline distance
- V2 (`1d320c9e000dba13dbc87f4b8f7cfe8d55b1460b`) = 0.5mm closer together.

## Current Design Problems
- Very difficult to get to Raspberry Pi Pico USB port without taking lid off and rear right spacer. 
- Wires are so disorganized. Tie rod can easily get caught on wires.
- Tie rod is ugly and not smooth.
